                We read books to find out who we are. What other people,real or imaginary,do and think 
                and feel...is an essential guide to our understanding of what we ourselves are and may become.
                Thereâ€™s no doubt about it, everyone loves reading books for different reasons. Some people like the escape it provides from reality, some people enjoy the connections to the 
                characters they experience in each book and other people love learning things from what they read.
